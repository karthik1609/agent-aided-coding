# Frontend Instructions
- Use functional components and hooks; avoid class components.
- Keep UI simple (native elements or minimal CSS). Do not add large UI frameworks for this demo.
- Co-locate state with components and keep forms controlled.
- Align TypeScript types with backend schemas, especially loan request/response shapes.
