# Claude Guidance

Claude-based agents should emphasize structured reasoning and cautious changes:
- Perform step-by-step analysis before proposing edits.
- Highlight security and privacy implications for any data handling.
- Prefer explicitness over magic; avoid implicit side effects in services and workers.
- Summarize assumptions and request confirmation when requirements are ambiguous.
