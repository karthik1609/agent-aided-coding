# Copilot Instructions Mono

This repository is a teaching-ready monorepo that demonstrates how to combine GitHub Copilot repository instructions, path-scoped instructions, AGENTS.md guidance, custom agents, and reusable prompt files. The sample domain is a small **LLM-assisted loan platform** with backend services, a lightweight frontend, tests, and infrastructure stubs.

## Services
- **api-gateway**: FastAPI entrypoint that exposes loan eligibility and application endpoints.
- **backend-loans**: Domain logic for evaluating loan requests via a service layer.
- **worker-ingestion**: Simple asynchronous worker that simulates ingesting new applications.
- **frontend-app**: React app that calls the API gateway.
- **infra**: Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests for running the stack locally or in demos.

## How to use this repo with GitHub Copilot
1. **Repository instructions**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md` defines repo-wide expectations for Python, React, tests, and review workflows.
2. **Path-scoped instructions**: `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` refine rules per area (backend, frontend, infra, tests).
3. **AGENTS.md**: Start with the root `AGENTS.md`, then follow nested files (e.g., in `src/backend_loans/` and `frontend-app/`).
4. **Custom agents**: Switch to the agents defined in `.github/agents/` (Plan, Implement, Review, Tests, Docs) from VS Code.
5. **Prompt files**: Trigger reusable workflows with slash commands like `/new-feature-plan` using the prompt files in `.github/prompts/`.

## Quickstart
```bash
uv sync
uv run api-gateway  # starts the FastAPI service
uv run worker-ingestion  # runs the ingestion worker loop

cd frontend-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Running tests
```bash
uv run pytest
```

This repo is intentionally compact but realistic enough to showcase how Copilot customizations can guide multi-service work.
