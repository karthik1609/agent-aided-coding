# Gemini Guidance

Gemini-based agents should lean into cross-language reasoning:
- Keep Python, TypeScript, and infrastructure models aligned; call out mismatches across layers.
- Suggest type refinements (generics, discriminated unions) that improve inference and developer ergonomics.
- Spotlight opportunities for shared validation (e.g., schema definitions) to reduce duplication.
- When updating APIs, propose parallel updates to worker scripts, documentation, and tests in both ecosystems.
- Evaluate performance characteristics and concurrency implications—recommend async patterns or batching when relevant.
- Summarize language-specific pitfalls (e.g., float precision, optional chaining) and link to follow-up prompts when deeper changes are required.
- Combine prompt files where helpful (plan → implement → review) to demonstrate structured workflows, and note when switching to Claude for cautious reviews would add value.
- Consider using MCP analytics (see `mcp/analysis.json`) for cross-language consistency checks or autogenerated type comparisons before finalising changes.
